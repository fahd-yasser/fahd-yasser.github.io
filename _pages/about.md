I am a second year PhD Student in Computer Vision at the University of Bristol supervised by Dr. Michael Wray. My research focuses on investigating sources and impact biases in vision-language models. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked for four years as a Machine Learning Engineer, developing business-critical systems for chatbots, Opical Character Recognition (OCR), and document understanding.
